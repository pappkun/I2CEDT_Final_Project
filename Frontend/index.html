        <h2>Enhance your resume with AI Resume Checker</h2>
        <p>
            Revime is a tool designed to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of a resume by analyzing its content, structure, and presentation.
            The system provides a numerical score between 0 and 100, where 0 indicates a very weak resume and 100 indicates an excellent, highly competitive resume.
        </p>

        <h3>The rating is determined based on several criteria:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Content Relevance:</strong> Checks whether the resume highlights relevant experience, skills, and achievements aligned with the target job.</li>
            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Evaluates logical flow and clarity in your resume. Well-structured resumes with clear wording and consistent style score higher.</li>
            <li><strong>Language & Professionalism:</strong> Analyzes grammar, tone, and use of professional language. Avoiding vague phrases and filler words increases the score.</li>
            <li><strong>Skills & Keywords:</strong> Looks for industry-specific keywords and technical skills that match job descriptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact & Achievements:</strong> Measures how well accomplishments are quantified (e.g., “increased sales by 30%” rather than “helped sales”).</li>
        </ul>
